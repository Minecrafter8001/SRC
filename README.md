Starbase Research Calculator

Takes data from the included json file. Data may not be up to date and/or incomplete.

Current features:
- Basic functionality: calculating craft quantities per item to fulfill target research points. Such as 1,000 cube (red) research.
- Basic research set functionality: calculating item sets to fulfill combined target research points. Such as 1,000 power (yellow) and 2,000 gear (purple) research.
- Set desired result quantity. Default is 5 suggested object results, may be increased as desired.
- Display material amounts, estimated cost in credits, estimated crafting time (most items still need this value).
- Research efficiency, expressed as total research points divided by total kv.
- All crafting object data table, searchable, for quick reference.

Planned:
Taking into consideration when an object generates more than one research type, specially for the "set functionality".
Maybe adding a JSON editor, so user may update the JSON data source from the page itself.
